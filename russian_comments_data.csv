12,2018-03-23 07:00:07,truckshark,"My extremely close, fun, trusting, platonic friendship with my sister is largely the result of the lust I once felt for her.

I'm a couple of years older than my sister, but we started puberty at about the same time. I had felt sexual attraction to girls since I was a small child, I'm guessing that my natural inhibitions are just lower than the norm. Anyway, when she started developing her body I was attracted to it. Very.

We were comfortable with each other (we soon got along better with each other than any of our other siblings) and she had the innocence of the 10-year-old she was, so I ended up seeing stuff every once in a while. Nip slips, changing with the door open, etc. I was so ashamed and scared, but also desperately pubescently horny. So, I naturally went about things the same way stupid boys do with girls: I treated her like a princess.

Now, she was a bit of a brat growing up, and we treated her like it, so she must have noticed when I started treating her differently. As far as I could (and can) tell, she was appreciative that at least one person in the family enjoyed spending time with her. Wrestling on the couch. Playing video games together. Going to the local pool. I was damn distracted, but still enjoying my time with her. Trying desperately not to be caught in my sneaking glances or be too obvious with my physicality.

It was torturous. The cognitive dissonance between caring about her and what's appropriate in general, and desperately wanting her body, was one of the biggest struggles of my childhood. I remember one night on vacation we slept in the same bed in a hotel room. I stayed up the whole night, all too aware of her beside me. How thin her pajamas were, how easy it would be to stick out my hand and explore, wondering if it would wake her up.

Fortunately, I won this struggle. Nothing happened that night. Shortly afterward, I decided that I needed to get my life back in order (as a thirteen year old, I already felt like my life was a mess) and decided to completely repress any urges or thoughts related to her whatsoever. It took months, and my shame didn't go away for a long time. I honestly have no idea where I got the massive resolve needed.

Now, we're very close, and I never think or feel about her sexually. I suppose on a subconscious level I still know that her body is attractive, but I don't regard it as a prospect any more. We're closer than any of our other family members, to the point that we think almost exactly the same thoughts at the same time (even though our personalities are different in plenty of ways) and have tons of inside jokes. We have so much fun together, and I honestly believe that it was largely caused by my childhood maneuverings.

Nowadays, I'm almost exclusively attracted to women of other ethnicity (my first few girlfriends probably had a lot to do with that), which I'm convinced helps; however, as an adult, I've discovered with a bit of fear and disgust that I also have somewhat of an attraction to girls the age she was when this started (9+, barely starting puberty). It's not as strong as attraction to women my age, however, and I'm not worried at all. I talked to a therapist a bit about that part just to be sure that all is well; despite some weird challenges along the way, all certainly is well.

I answer questions from companies about how to comply with the law, I draw up contracts and other legal documents, and when the company is sued I help present its arguments before the court.

A lot of people think lawyers are immoral when they defend corporations, but I disagree. (1) Regardless of who's right, it's simply not a fair trial if the party being sued for millions of dollars is denied access to legal advice and representation. (2) Companies are in the right more often than you'd think. We get a lot of ridiculous lawsuits from individuals obviously after the company's deep pockets. (3) Many lawsuits boil down to simple misunderstandings between companies about contract terms, and 9x out of 10 we end up settling out of court once the parties come to an agreement.

This incident is mentioned here. Taken from (https://www.coldcase-earons.com/27.php)

11-7-77: 5:40 p.m.
LE received a call from Sergeant Ortiz of the California State Campus Police regarding a note written on the bathroom wall in a campus restroom. The note, according to Ortiz, concerned information about the East Area Rapist. At 6:10 p.m., LE met with Ortiz in the library at the University. The men's room located on the main floor of the building, in the middle stall on the right hand side, written in pencil, was a message which stated, ""The East Side Rapist was here / Will rape my first black girl tonight / Dumb cops will never find me."" They photographed the message.

I still believe that the release of documents related Tom EARs is possible via FOIA requests. It would be interesting if someone has a list of all EARS related FOIA requests ever filed.

3,2018-03-22 13:46:49,crownalbum,"Spider-Man not only because he's relatable, but because he's full of interesting dichotomies that people often overlook. He's one of the only superheroes with dual classic origins. It was common during the Gold and Silver Ages for characters to be bestowed with powers via some outside accident (Flash/Hulk) or to become exceptional through their own brilliance and ingenuity (Batman/Iron Man). Both of these play an important part in Spider-Man's origin. He gets bitten by the radioactive spider, but without his brilliance in science, he couldn't create the webshooters, an iconic and essential part of his power set. As originally conceived, he's just as responsible for becoming Spider-Man as the accident is. The organic webshooters from the Raimi films completely eliminates this unique aspect of the character and his origins.

He's a nerd and he's not. Most people with only peripheral familiarity with the character think he's always the stereotypical nerd (glasses/always picked on etc) but, although he starts out this way, the character quickly evolves out of this phase (as one realistically would after gaining exceptional powers). The most recognizable version (to comic fans) comes from an era in which the character is social and juggles romantic interests (Gwen Stacy, Mary Jane, Felicia Hardy...) and his failures in these areas stem from his crime-fighting responsibilities getting in the way of his normal life not because he's the perpetual nerd.

The tragedy of his origin also makes for one of the most justifiable reasons to do what he does. Like Batman, Spider-Man puts on the mask because of the murder of a loved one, but unlike Batman, he is partially responsible for the events leading to Ben's death. Bruce Wayne starts on his path after his parents' death, but there was nothing he could do to prevent it. Peter had all the power and opportunity to prevent his Uncle's death but refused to stop a criminal out of selfishness. It's this guilt that drives him not just the tragedy.

Spider-Man is not relatable because he's an everyman. Between his powers and his intellect, he's anything but. What's interesting about the character is that he's so relatable despite not being an everyman.

To be fair I'm most of the time disappointed by the lack of quality sci fi (and fantasy to a lesser extent) movies and series.

I recommend stuff like Firefly if you haven't seen. And the Twilight Zone because it's amazing.

I noticed that I love all the ""kids"" universes and themes: science fiction, western, pirates and also fantasy. I'm sad that most of the stuff using these themes are either old, sad as hell, or bad. But we still have some great stuff.

So to answer: Tomorrowland was probably my favorite movie last year.

But that is not a common thing. In some places bartenders prepare drinks strictly in the order that was made by orders. That happens in large bars usually because it's hard to remember everything when you distract yourself. So in this kind of places the best way to get your drink is to wait calmly.

I read a few sections of Craigslist nearly daily and read about a dog that was lost and the owner was pleading with everyone everyday to keep an eye out for her beloved doggy and updating with sightings and the sort. This went on for maybe two weeks. You could tell she loved the dog and was really heartbroken; I felt awful for her.

Then it seems the dog is found / rescued but the ""finders"" refuse to return the dog to the owner. This just kills the owner and she doesn't know where the dog is being kept / where these people live...etc. She continues to post about it on Craigslist begging these people to return her dog.

Well its December 3rd, 2008 and I'm at work. Suddenly someone yells fire and yep, it's my jeep She's on fire. Burns to the ground. Awful, awful day. I have the Mr. pick me up at work and instead of going home we head right to the bar so I can grieve properly. We're drinking in the middle of the workday at this bar and there's hardly anyone else in there and we're making conversation with the bartender. I talked about shopping for a new jeep and Craigslist comes up. From here I mention this stranger's problem with the dog and how sad it is/I'd kill someone if they stole my dog/they must be crushed...etc. Well the bartender chimes in with, ""Is it a white husky? My neighbor at the apartment complex all of a sudden has this white husky that showed up out of thin air and to be honest my neighbors are kinda dicks so that sounds like something they'd do.""

I email the lost dog lady putting her in touch with bartender lady. They involve the police. Turns out it WAS her dog and the police got him back for her and they all lived happily ever after. YAY.

49,2016-05-16 04:19:33,1488reasons,"> John Key is a political grandmaster 

Let's be realistic here. Key is, at best, an awkward man who is uncomfortable talking off the cuff and has had fortunate windfalls. 

* He has money, and money can buy gold-class PR advice, which mean you don't have to think hard when the cameras are on. Just stick to the script and all is fine.

* The media here is even more powerless, staffed by spineless yes-men who are more interested in clicks than in reporting, and entirely uninterested in journalism than most other English-speaking nations. This makes it even easier to get away with scripted sound-bites when you know not one mainstream voice will question you, and even if they do, you can easily exploit the fickle ADD of the news cycle to ignore it because there will be no on-going investigations. 

* The population who votes, and who get their political news from this same media, also aren't bothered by how things are. Most of them benefit from it, whether you're an Auckland property investor or a dairy farmer. Everything is fine, or at least looks fine, for them. That rosy outlook means any problems they do encounter aren't due to them and the things they like (which means Key and his National government). No one gives away their golden egg, and there is no incentive to look to the effects of this way of thinking on future generations or the long-term stability of the nation as a whole. 

* The opposition is so embarrassingly weak and ineffectual that the popularity of an awkward banker who has to buy coaching and rely on having lucked into a crippled media and receptive voting demographic in order to have a semblance of popularity (which he still has to pay for), and in other times and places would be highly unpopular, continues to stump them. This is one part due to a constant need to define themselves as *against John Key* rather than pushing a strong positive vision, and one part because they have even less of a grasp of the media and how to generate favorable public sentiment than a stiff banker who had to buy his popularity. This leaves them both unable to generate any positive movement and wide open to Key's counters.

An actual grandmaster would wipe the floor with Key, much the way Trump has cleaned house in the US against people who are cut from the same milquetoast cardboard. Key is a big fish in small backwater, who has paid for big-ticket PR coaching and been fortunate enough to exploit it in a slew of favorable circumstances. If Labour wants to attack Key in a way that sticks, they need to get a better grip on what moves voters and how to leverage the media to make use of that knowledge.",13,0,13,PM 'out of touch' on Auckland housing,http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/303990/pm-%27out-of-touch%27-on-auckland-housing-labour,newzealand

>**1. Human sexuality is an objective biological binary trait: “XY” and “XX” are genetic markers of health – not genetic markers of a disorder.** The norm for human design is to be conceived either male or female. Human sexuality is binary by design with the obvious purpose being the reproduction and flourishing of our species. This principle is self-evident. The exceedingly rare disorders of sex development (DSDs), including but not limited to testicular feminization and congenital adrenal hyperplasia, are all medically identifiable deviations from the sexual binary norm, and are rightly recognized as disorders of human design. Individuals with DSDs do not constitute a third sex.


>**3. A person’s belief that he or she is something they are not is, at best, a sign of confused thinking.** When an otherwise healthy biological boy believes he is a girl, or an otherwise healthy biological girl believes she is a boy, an objective psychological problem exists that lies in the mind not the body, and it should be treated as such. These children suffer from gender dysphoria. Gender dysphoria (GD), formerly listed as Gender Identity Disorder (GID), is a recognized mental disorder in the most recent edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association (DSM-V).5 The psychodynamic and social learning theories of GD/GID have never been disproved.


>**8. Conditioning children into believing a lifetime of chemical and surgical impersonation of the opposite sex is normal and healthful is child abuse.** Endorsing gender discordance as normal via public education and legal policies will confuse children and parents, leading more children to present to “gender clinics” where they will be given puberty-blocking drugs. This, in turn, virtually ensures that they will “choose” a lifetime of carcinogenic and otherwise toxic cross-sex hormones, and likely consider unnecessary surgical mutilation of their healthy body parts as young adults.",0,0,0,North Shore barber refuses to cut transgender person's hair,http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11618046,newzealand

For this to be true requires a serious mangling of the left-right spectrum as it is ordinarily defined. In loosest terms the Left is revolutionary and progressive, they want to change and transform existing institutions. The Right wishes to preserve them. 

What passes for the left-right spectrum in recent NZ politics is closer to a doctrinal dispute among revolutionary progressives about what kind of radical change is for the best. The left-wingers you refer to want redistribution of wealth for what they take as the collective social good. 

The pseudo-right of the National Party wants to enact transformation by eroding the existing social and cultural institutions in favor of a politically borderless and economically homogenous global order centered on the interests of elites, mainly in the US and the UK. This is a very recent development, since the 1980s and 90s, and it coincides with the predominance of neoconservative policies in Western nations, which assimilated a revision of classical economic liberalism (""neoliberalism"").

27,2017-12-25 03:35:36,riversailor,"SegWit is already activated by the miners. For SegWit to have an effect, more addresses need to support it (wallets) as well, since the nodes will only use SegWit if the address sends the transaction using it. Right now only 10% of transactions are SegWit, which is why block size has been creeping above 1MB over the fall. It seems to have gotten stuck, though, because too many addresses still haven’t upgraded.

Lightning will be hugely important. We need it soon, and we need a new generation of walkers that (1) support SegWit and (2) do a better job of selecting the right fee level for the transaction.

For years the network was lightly loaded and many wallets (including the on-line wallet services like Coinbase) used a naive approach to transactions and didn’t optimize the fee offer for the transaction type: some transactions don’t need to be in the next 2 blocks (I can wait a day, if I’m sending money to London, so I don’t need to offer much of a fee), but the wallets I’ve used don’t offer me an interface for fee negotiation/estimation.

I’m not an expert, however. If you are, and I’ve made an error here, please point it out. I’m not embarrassed by being wrong as long as I learn something from it ;-)",1,0,1,"If whining bitcoin companies really want to solve the high transaction fee “problem”, they could implement #SegWit and @Lighting within a couple months.

8,2017-06-06 16:46:43,RobbyDelaware,"I agree with you that it has been quiet lately. My two cents about it: I was a long time resident of Seattle, and I find it interesting that there has been virtually zero coverage of the case in the Seattle media.

I find it interesting that the Seattle Times [did such a good thing] (http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/special-reports/my-god-thats-kimberly-online-sleuth-solves-perplexing-mystery-of-identity-thief-lori-ruff/)with their coverage of the Lori Ruff story. Yet, virtually no media outlets in the Puget Sound have covered the Stevik story.

Considering how much people have obsessed over the case, you'd think that there would be interest in additional coverage in the case from the Seattle media. 

I think that perhaps now would be the appropriate time to consider ways to coordinate attempting to get this case additional coverage. 

I would like to think that Seattle's excellent [KUOW](http://kuow.org/contact-us) or the Seattle Times itself could be options.

If there were a change in the status of the case, perhaps law enforcement in Gray's Harbor would be willing to discuss this update.

14,2017-03-28 14:36:43,RobbyDelaware,"Interesting to thinking about. According to Google Translator, there looks to be little difference between ""Stevik"" and ""Stevic"" - meaning that if ""Lyle Stevik"" was his actual name, and if he was an immigrant from Eastern Europe, he could have been using both spellings interchangeably. 

Here's ""Lyle Stevic"" in Macedonian: Лајл Стевиќ

Here's ""Lyle Stevik"" (with the ""k"") in Macedonian: Лајл Стевик

Notice the only difference is the accent character.

I've seen this (people using multiple spellings, especially if they aren't that familiar with Latin characters) happen before with Eastern Europeans - how many times have you been admonished by an airline to make sure that your ticket stub exactly matches what is printed on your passport?

Anyways, I ran some searches for ""Лајл Стевик"" and ""Лајл Стевиќ"" - which is ""Lyle Stevik"" and ""Lyle Stevic"" in the Macedonian language. No Google results were returned - as I don't believe ""Lyle"" in any iteration actually translates into Macedonian. 

I did, however, find a missing person case for one ""Slaviša Stević"" - which would also translate to ""Slavisa Stevick"".

Mentally disabled man who disappeared from Kosovo in 1999 - investigation was initially closed after it was reported he moved to Serbia. Case later reopened at the behest of the father:

He (along with 3 other ""Stevics/Steviks"") appeared in a news release from 2001 - all reported as being kidnapped. 

https://www.mail-archive.com/ctrl@listserv.aol.com/msg62170.html

Kind of interesting, but I doubt it is related to old Lyle.

1. Same as you can't teach a fish to climb a tree, you can't force a dog to live underwater. Neither is a pussy for wanting to live in their original environment. I will let others to pursue the ideal of a ""strong woman"" if they wish.

2. YOU, Dysphoria, don't make sense. Maybe my 'self' is a guy, and there are no rules against being a feminine/flamboyant guy. And if someone thinks there are, they're simply projecting sexist bullshit onto others.

3. Disorder breeds disorder. I am a broken wooden post that can't hold the roof anymore. I need fixing. If I break, the roof will fall and I won't be supporting it. If I'm repaired, things will stay in place and the order is preserved. The only selfish thing here would be to push others away, give in to dysphoric thoughts, decide that everyone's against me while most likely they just don't understand why I'm breaking. That helps no one. Anyone can create disorder out of weakness, but it takes some strength to do otherwise.

First of all, Bitcoin, many people think, has already started to decay. The price of Bitcoin felt, and it's impossible to predict whether it will recover or not. 

Secondly, in contrast to Bitcoin that is considered as a mostly speculative instrument, Ethereum is a powerful platform giving a lot of opportunities to create new projects.

Thirdly, it is important to note that 80% of the daily transactions across a lot of coins run on Ethereum which means that it has a strong position.

A man was raised as a Samurai, but when he was finally of age to serve, his master died, and he was not allowed to commit seppuku. It was the beginning of a hundred years of peace, and thus this Samurai of a proud clan had to sit by and watch society fall apart, as the martial path fell to the wayside.

As an old man, a young scribe would sit and chat with him, and write down all his nuggets of wisdom.

It's written very much like the ramblings of an old man, and sometimes contradicts itself, but it is a guide to living by action, honour, and accountability.

Though it is a few hundred years old, it is shocking how many parallels there are between his society and ours today.

Seriously I only discovered what philosophy actually is until after I left school. Not only is it really interesting but it's really helpful. Philosophy teaches you to question what you're faced with, and approach problems with logic not belief. It's the cure for gullibility and ignorance. It helps you take control of your base emotions and think clearly. This is coming from someone who used to be seriously irrationally angry over very tiny things in his life. That fucking sucked.

Read it in high school and the ending just blew me away. I was even more impressed how the entire class didn't spoil the ending for each other. It clicked with me that you can't get everything right, sometimes shit needs to happen whether you like it or not and dealing with it is a whole other adventure.

Seriously give it a read, it's very short classic(only 100 pages from memory).

And DON'T spoil it for yourself or anyone else. As tempting as it is. If a class of highschool kids could do it, you can.

75,2018-01-10 08:05:46,horseeating,"I think it's a process. 24 hour news cycle creates a demand for more newsworthy content. They inflate minor controversies to what they consider newsworthy levels. They also give voice to very small minorities who do actually feel offended, but historically would have been dismissed, rightly so, as not newsworthy. So we are much more exposed to people being offended by things, and we start to see the world in those terms. We have been trained to look for things that are ""offensive"" even if they don't actually offend us personally. We get offended on other people's behalf, which isn't always a bad thing, but it can lead to a situation where no one is genuinely offended by something but we're all acting offended so as not to seem offensive. Eventually people become hypersensitive to potentially offense causing behavior and are empowered to vocalize it.

That's not to say that there aren't offensive things out there worth speaking up about. I think our society is better when it allows people to have an open discussion about those things. There is a danger though, of raising every seeming offense to an equal level.

4,2015-07-11 07:38:13,UelitheLandagelv,"I say about mutual agreement where there is no violence. Moreover, we should listen what a victim says. Maybe husband and wife are both into BDSM, but the judge can be sure that it is domestic violence. Should be couple jailed if the law says that acts affecting body is a crime? Mutual agreement is very important point!

P.S.  According to a 1998 study of college students who experienced sexual relationships with an adult while still a minor found that the adolescent was not harmed by mutually consensual sexual experiences. When harm was discovered the harm came from the adolescent's dysfunctional family of origin not from the sexual relationship with the adult. The study also included a statistical study of thousand of older record of alleged adolescent sexual abuse by an adult and found the same relation between mutually agreed upon sex between the adolescent and an adult did not cause any emotional harm. Where harm was found the statistical analysis shows the harm predated the sexual relationship and was the results of a dysfunctional family of origin not the sexual relationship.

1) IOTA has the huge team - a lot of people are now working with iota foundation and lead developer is Come from beyond - inventor of proof of stake.

2) Partnerships - BOSCH bought a lot of IOTA. Volkswagen has a person in IOTA foundation. A huge amount of participants in DATA marketplace. TOKYO partnership, now Taipei partnership and a LOT of smaller projects. Even Oyster pearl - a favourite here- is made on IOTA tangle.

3) Follow the progress - if you watch closely there is so much going on with IOTA - IOTA foundation is doing so much atm. There are third parties working on IOTA as well - for example, ROMAN SEMKO - check him out.

Maybe husband and wife are both into BDSM, but the judge can be sure that it is domestic violence. Should be couple jailed if the law says that acts affecting body is a crime? Mutual agreement is very important point!

P.S.  According to a 1998 study of college students who experienced sexual relationships with an adult while still a minor found that the adolescent was not harmed by mutually consensual sexual experiences. When harm was discovered the harm came from the adolescent's dysfunctional family of origin not from the sexual relationship with the adult. The study also included a statistical study of thousand of older record of alleged adolescent sexual abuse by an adult and found the same relation between mutually agreed upon sex between the adolescent and an adult did not cause any emotional harm. Where harm was found the statistical analysis shows the harm predated the sexual relationship and was the results of a dysfunctional family of origin not the sexual relationship.

Be real. This is not a one on one affair. there were cops. not a cop. warnings made to a madman to stop running? that man could have been kicked once in the face and that was all. Did the mad man run towards people on the streets to kill them? Ha its funny when you talk like that rewatch the video again man. Atleaaaast a shot in the leg!!!!! common u want me to believe that running guy was in a kill chase? sometimes you know we gotta be real. For me that killing was so uncalled for. And its wrong to defend them thinking about them risking their lives.

u trying to say cops arent trained enough for that. Than man had no weapon for christ sake and there were more than one cop. i saw so many videos of how cops in other states deal with mad people. Taking someone's life really isn't and shouldn't be an option for cops unless there is really the need to. Its just like an ordinary man putting on the uniform, grabs 1 or 2 weapons/tools and goes out there to protect citizens. Cops are and should be trained get that point please. they could have done pretty much better trust me. Its so sad we dont understand such cases because these victims are no relatives to us.

305,2016-04-22 09:41:14,Maxwel_Terry," 1. Start Small - Start with something you can do immediately and easily. When we start with small successes, we build momentum to gain more confidence in our abilities.
2. Create a Compelling Vision - Use the power of your imagination. Create an image of yourself as the confident and self-assured person you aspire to become. 
3. Socialize - Get out of the house or setup a lunch date with a friend. Socializing with others will give us opportunities to connect with other people, and practice our communication and interpersonal skills. 
4. Do Something that Scares You - As with all skills, we get better with practice and repetition. The more often we proactively do things that scare us, the less scary these situations will seem, and eventually will be rid of that fear.
5. Do Something You Are Good At - What are you especially good at or enjoy doing? Regularly doing things that you are good at reinforces your belief in your abilities and strengths. I (Tina) can be very efficient with completing errands or administrative work.
6. Set Goals - According to a study done at Virginia Tech, 80% of Americans say they don’t have goals. And the people who regularly write down their goals earn nine times as much over their lifetime as people who don’t.
7. Help Others Feel Good About Themselves - Help somebody or teach them something. When you help other people feel better about themselves and like themselves more, it will make you feel good about yourself. 
8. Get Clarity on Life Areas - Get clarity on the life area that needs the most attention. Your self-esteem is the average of your self-concept in all the major areas of your life. Write down all the major categories of your life, e.g., health, relationships, finance, etc. 
9. Create a Plan - Having a goal alone won’t do much. Get clarity on your action items. One of the biggest reasons people get lazy is because they don’t have a plan to achieve their goals. 
10. Get Motivated - Read something inspirational, listen to something empowering, talk to someone who can uplift our spirits, who can motivate us to become a better person, to live more consciously, and to take proactive steps towards creating a better life for ourselves and our families.
11. Get External Compliments - As funny as this point suggests, go find a friend or family member and ask them “What do you like about me?” “What are my strengths?” or “What do you love about me?” We will often value other people’s opinions more than our own.
12. Affirmations & Introspection - Use affirmations, but in the right way. Some people think that when they’re in a slump, using positive affirmations will help them get out of it. I love affirmations, but I’ve realized you have to use them in the right way. 
13. No More Comparisons - Stop comparing yourself to other people. Low-self esteem stems from the feeling of being inferior. For example, if you were the only person in the world, do you think you could have low-self esteem? Self-esteem only comes into the picture when there are other people around us and we perceive that we are inferior.
